# Booking_System
An application that enables users to book seats in a stand for sporting events

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a booking system. The application will allow users to select and deselect seats of their choice relative to available games within the current season

Users will have access to a personal profile that holds personal information and any relevant data about seats they have reserved

The end product will be a 3 tire application with passed tests that consolidate all functionality.
