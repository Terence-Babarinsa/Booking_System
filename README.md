# Booking_System
An application that enables users to book seats in a stand for sporting events

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a booking system. The application will allow users to select and deselect seats of their choice relative to available games within the current season

Users will have access to a personal profile that holds personal information and any relevant data about seats they have reserved

The end product will be a 3 tire application with passed tests that consolidate all functionality.

# Database ERD

# Sprint Breakdown
## Sprint 1
### Sprint Goals
The goal for this sprint was to draw up my database erd's, create my databse, scaffold my database and create the methods for my code behind my user interface
### Sprint Review
I was able to complete two of my sprint goals. Bottlenecks came forth when designing the methods for my code behind due to underestimating the time required. Writing up the code for my methods will be pushed onto the next sprint.
### Sprint Retrospective
One of the blockers for this sprint was forgetting to re-scaffold my database whenever I made any changes to the tables after the first scaffold. Another was my underestimating of the time required to code up the methods for my code behind.
